Your alarm goes off, and you wake up feeling so relaxed and well rested.
You get out of bed, yawn and stretch, look out the window, and smile.
It's a gorgeous morning, and you have a great sense of optimism.
You head into the bathroom to brush your teeth.
Wow! You're looking great this morning!
One thing catches your eye though. 
Your right eye tooth. It just ...
flashed or something.
You look closer ... and you see it's discolored.
Now you feel a slight stirring of uneasiness in the pit of your belly.
Part of you wants to ignore it.
But part of you wants to look closer.
"""

tooth_dialogue = """
What the?!?
You see that the eye tooth has a brilliant, bright green eye.
The eye blinks at you innocently,
and then you hear a thin, whispery voice.\n
TOOTH: I am your inner voice. Your true essential self; your deepest wisdom.
YOU: Shouldn't that be the role of my wisdom teeth?
TOOTH: You had them extracted, remember?
We upper eye teeth are heirs to their throne.
YOU: So why is it just you? What happened to my other eye tooth?
TOOTH: Oh, him? He's kind of a deadbeat. I'm all you've got now.
YOU: So why now? What do you want from me?
TOOTH: The question is, what do you want from me?
If you can answer all three of my questions correctly,
I can make you very happy.
Are you game?
"""

tooth_brushing = """
You start brushing your teeth, pretending nothing weird happened just now.
But something's off.
Your eye tooth is wiggling as you brush.
You stop brushing and gingerly take hold of your eye tooth with your fingers.
As soon as you touch it, it falls into the palm of your hand!
You look in the mirror and see a ridiculous gap where your tooth once was.
You close your eyes in anguish. Why you?!
All of a sudden, like an avalanche, all of your teeth start falling into your mouth.
You are horrified, and start screaming.
What do you scream?
"""

riddle1 = """
Your eye tooth clears its throat.
'The first riddle is the easiest,' it says.\n
'What is the name of a surface with only one side
and only one boundary component?'
"""

riddle1_fail = """
'Wow. I don't think you even tried,' says the eye tooth.
'I don't know why I even waste my time.' And with that, the eye closes, and
your tooth goes back to normal.\n
You decide the whole thing must have been a hallucination.\n
"""

riddle2 = """
'That's right!' the tooth says.
'Hey, remember that '80s band Pop Will Eat Itself?' asks the tooth.
'They were cool. Anyway, your second riddle is this:'\n
What is the name of the serpent that eats its own tail?
"""

riddle2_fail = """
'Geez louise,' says the eye tooth.
'That serpent may have its ass up its head,
but you have it the other way around.'
And with that, the eye closes, and your tooth goes back to normal.\n
"""

riddle3 = """
"'You got it!' says the tooth."
'Okay, last one, and then I'll grant you a wish.'
'You're really close!' the eye says, 'Don't screw it up:'\n
What is the last name
of the strange loop
who's most popular work
is often referred to by its acronym, G.E.B.?\n
"""

riddle3_fail = """
You hear a groan.
'Really?!? That's your answer?!?'
The eye tooth closes its eye and disappears.

wishes_opener = """
'Congratulations!' the eye tooth says, beaming with delight.
'You've correctly answered all three riddles!!!'\n
For that, you have your choice of three options, each of them a dream come true:
1. You can choose to be young again.
2. You can choose to experience true love.
3. You can choose to have the ability to fly.\n
What will it be?

\nThat wasn't one of your choices.

3. the ability to fly?\n

school_opener = """
You're suddenly in a large hallway filled with lockers.
It looks like a high school. In fact ...
it's YOUR high school!
You look down and realize you're a teenager again ... \n
and that you aren't wearing any pants.
Or underwear, for that matter.\n
Your heart starts racing.
The hallway is empty but you look at your watch and realize
that the bell is going to ring in 2 minutes.
Then everyone will come pouring out of the classrooms
to find you buck naked from the waist down.
You suddenly remember that you have some gym shorts in your locker.
You can either:\n
1. Make a run for a hiding place, or
2. Open your locker and get those shorts!\n
What's it going to be?
"""

locker_opener = """
You run to your locker ...\n
... and immediately draw a blank.
For the life of you, you can't remember your combination.
All you remember is that the first number is in the 30s,
the second number is in the 20s, and the third number is in the 40s.
You can squeeze in 10 tries before the bell rings.
Hurry!
"""

bomb_opener = """
CLICK.\n
Hooray! You did it!
You open the locker and grab your shorts, quickly putting them on.
You're about the close it again, when you hear something.\n
A ticking sound.\n
You push aside a notebook and freeze.
There is a ticking time bomb in your locker!!!!
It is counting down, 15 seconds, 14, 13 ... \n
Do you:
1. Try to defuse it and save the school, becoming a hero? Or
2. Run for your life and save yourself?
"""

defuse_opener = """
You see a blue wire and a pink wire.
You think if you pull out one, you might defuse the bomb.\n
On the other hand, you have no idea what you're doing.

\nThe bomb stops ticking!
The bell rings.
"""

\nThe bomb stops ticking!\n
You're about to breath a sigh of relief,
When it starts ticking again ... FASTER!!!\n
5 ... 4 ... 3 ... \n
You and everyone at the school are doomed.
You open your mouth to scream your dying words.\n
What do you scream?
